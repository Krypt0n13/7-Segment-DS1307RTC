# 7-Segment-DS1307RTC
A Script for a 7 Segment Display and a DS1307 RTC Time Module.

This is an small basic script to run a clock on a 7-Segment-Display.
The 7-Segment-Display is connected with an microcontroller and an DS1307 RTC (Real Time Clock Module).
Before you flash the RTC you need to make sure that the small batterie is correctly installed.
After flashling you can make sure that the RTC has the correct time via. serial monitor.


The Script and exact build have only been tested on the esp32 and the arduino uno.
It could possibly work with other microcontrollers aswell, as long as they have the deticated pins as the 
esp32 and arduino uno.

A wiring plan can be found in the files as well.
The Script for flashling the RTC is included as well.

The first and most import step is to buy following components:
DS1307 RTC Module
7-Segment-4-digit display by Adafruit
Esp32 or Arduino Uno or an microcontroller of your choice.


REMINDER: The Script is only optimized for the 7 Segment Display of Adafruit, i do not guarantee you that it will work
with other 7-segment-displays aswell, but the chances are there.

Before you are able to run the script and flash it on to your microcontroller you have to make sure the following libaries are installed.

-Adafruit_GFX Libary
-Adafruit_LED Backpack
-RTClib
